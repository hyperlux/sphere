# Supabase Integration & Debugging Report

## Overview

This report documents the process of configuring Supabase for the project, importing the database schema, debugging API issues, and addressing Row Level Security (RLS) policies. It concludes with the current working state and recommendations for securing data access.

---

## 1. Initial Setup

- Connected the app to an existing Supabase project.
- Verified environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) were correctly set.
- Confirmed Supabase client and server-side initialization.

---

## 2. Schema Design and Import

- Analyzed and corrected the provided SQL schema.
- Created tables for forum categories, topics, posts, votes, user profiles, etc.
- Fixed foreign key references to `auth.users(id)` and `public.users(id)`.
- Added missing tables like `forum_categories`.
- Enabled RLS and created initial policies.
- Successfully imported the schema into Supabase.

---

## 3. Supabase Client Configuration

- Client-side uses `@supabase/ssr` with public anon key.
- Server-side uses `@supabase/supabase-js` with the service role key.
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env.local`.

---

## 4. User Profile Handling

- Created a `public.users` table linked to `auth.users`.
- Updated the app to fetch profiles from `users` instead of a non-existent `profiles` table.
- Added logic to create a user profile on first login if missing.
- Made `username` nullable to avoid insert failures.

---

## 5. API Endpoint Debugging

- Focused on `/api/forum/categories/[categoryId]/topics` POST endpoint.
- Fixed join aliases from `profiles` to `users`.
- Added detailed logging of Supabase auth state, profile fetch, and insert payloads.
- Ensured the `author_id` in inserts matched the authenticated user ID.

---

## 6. Row Level Security (RLS) Issues

- Initial RLS policies blocked topic creation despite correct user ID.
- Relaxed policies, but inserts still failed.
- Disabled RLS temporarily, which allowed inserts to succeed.
- Confirmed that disabling RLS removes all row-level protections.

---

## 7. Final Working State

- The app can now create forum topics successfully.
- User profiles are created and fetched correctly.
- API endpoints return expected data.
- **RLS on `forum_topics` is currently disabled**, so all inserts succeed regardless of user.

---

## 8. Security Implications

- **Disabling RLS means anyone with the Supabase anon key can insert, update, or delete forum topics.**
- This is insecure for production environments.
- RLS should be re-enabled with strict policies to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## 9. Recommended Next Steps

- **Re-enable RLS** on `forum_topics`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.forum_topics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

- **Create a secure insert policy**:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated can insert topics" ON public.forum_topics;

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated can insert topics" ON public.forum_topics
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND author_id = auth.uid());
```

- **Test** that authenticated users can insert topics with their own `author_id`.
- **Add SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE policies** as needed to control access.
- **Avoid using the service role key** in client-side code; use it only server-side with proper checks.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The Supabase integration is now functional, with a working schema and API endpoints. However, to ensure data security, it is critical to re-enable RLS and enforce strict access policies before deploying to production.
