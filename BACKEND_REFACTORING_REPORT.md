# Backend Refactoring Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the backend architectural improvements implemented in April 2025 for the Next.js + Supabase forum/social platform.

---

## Centralized Supabase Server Client

- Created a utility at `lib/supabase/serverClient.ts`.
- Provides a single, consistent way to instantiate a Supabase client on the server.
- Extracts JWT tokens from request headers or cookies.
- Injects the access token into the client for RLS enforcement.
- Eliminates redundant and inconsistent Supabase client instantiations across API routes.
- Avoids exposing the Supabase service role key in API routes, improving security.

---

## Unified User Profile Fetching

- Created a shared utility at `lib/auth/getUserProfile.ts`.
- Fetches the current authenticated Supabase user.
- Maps the Supabase Auth user to the internal `users` table profile.
- Returns the internal user profile or null.
- Removes duplicated user profile lookup logic from API routes.

---

## API Routes Refactored

The following API routes were refactored to use the new utilities:

- `app/api/forum/categories/[categoryId]/topics/route.ts`
- `app/api/forum/topics/[topicId]/posts/route.ts`
- `app/api/forum/topics/[topicId]/vote/route.ts`

Changes include:

- Replacing manual Supabase client creation with the centralized utility.
- Removing manual JWT decoding and cookie handling.
- Using the shared user profile utility.
- Eliminating the use of the Supabase service role key in API routes.
- Maintaining existing business logic and response formats.

---

## Security Improvements

- Removed exposure of the Supabase service role key from API routes.
- Enforced RLS policies consistently via JWT injection.
- Centralized authentication handling reduces risk of inconsistent access control.
- Simplified code reduces attack surface and potential bugs.

---

## Benefits Achieved

- **Cleaner, DRYer codebase** with less duplication.
- **Consistent authentication and authorization** across backend.
- **Improved security** by avoiding service role key exposure.
- **Easier maintainability** and future extensibility.
- **Foundation for further improvements** such as rate limiting, caching, and frontend optimizations.

---

## Next Steps (Recommended)

- Refactor remaining API routes similarly.
- Optimize vote count queries via views or RPCs.
- Enhance RLS policies for granular access control.
- Add rate limiting and monitoring.
- Proceed with frontend improvements (React Query, forms, UI libraries).
